# The-Straight-Line
Not *yet* the best code but...
Implementation and visualization of calculation of gradients, distance between points and even their midpoints
=====HOW TO USE=====
1. to check the disatnce between the last 2 points, simply click the mouse button in the required position as directed in the view of x and y coordinates at the bottom right of the screen, mark the spots  and click the Distance button, it is better you don't move the mouse as soon as that until you've seen the distance at the bottom right, else you have to click it again
2. to find the midpoint of 2 points, you mark the spots as directed earlier, then click the midpiont button, but you can't check for the midpoint of the last two points, you can only check for the first 2 points, sorry about that, you have to refresh the grid page with the refresh button, it is available at the bottom, near the distace and midpoint as well, make sure to note that the big red 'X' that appears when finding the midpoint states the midpoint is at the '"X's" top left, that way you would see it is accurate ;)
3. You can also find the gradients of the first 2 points on the grid page by clicking the gradient button at the bottom of the screen

===more about it===
The code simply helps you mark out points with the mouse button and check the distance, midpoint, or gradients, it calculates them and rounds them to the nearest 1 decimal in pixels
Update is coming soon (maybe another repo) of using this in an actual scaled map that would be able to measure distance, midpoint gradients and if possible some other stuff, but in 
cm this time, so it can actually be able to check real distances, and other stuff

===Help needed===
Feel free to give constructive feedback or criticism, your help is needed to optimise this project to it's maximum potential,
The program needs accuracy tests and likewise contributions, feel free to contribute anyway you can, thank you
