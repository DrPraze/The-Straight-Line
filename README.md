# The-Straight-Line
Implementation of calculation of gradients, distance between points and even their midpoints
this is a program to visualize distance between two points and the midpoint of the line segment
=====HOW TO USE=====
1. to check the disatnce between the last 2 points, simply click the mouse button in the required position as directed in the view of x and y coordinates at the bottom right of the screen, mark the spots  and click the Distance button, it is better you don't move the mouse as soon as that until you've seen the distance at the bottom right, else you have to click it again
2. to find the midpoint of 2 points, you mark the spots as directed earlier, then click the midpiont button, but you can't check for the midpoint of the last two points, you can only check for the first 2 points, sorry about that, you have to refresh the grid page with the refresh button, it is available at the bottom, near the distace and midpoint as well, make sure to note that the big red 'X' that appears when finding the midpoint states the midpoint is at the '"X's" top left, that way you would see it is accurate ;)
3. You can also find the gradients of the first 2 points on the grid page by clicking the gradient button at the bottom of the screen
